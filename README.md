## TactiMation
#### *An open-source project to create tactical animation scenes more easily.*

Best results on **desktop** using the **chrome browser** in **fullscreen mode** (the site layout is not responsive yet).

### Want to contribute?

Contributions are very welcome! 

Some features to add: 
* option to `export as video` instead of GIF
* Add voronoi surface
* Ability to create multiple scenes and concatenate them to form a single export (this would be legit :fire:)
* Undo/Redo button to undo/redo the last trace made
